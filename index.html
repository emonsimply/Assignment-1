      <p>"Poverty is not merely the absence of income but the absence of opportunities. In a world abundant with
        resources, it is not scarcity but inequality that divides us. We must reshape our systems to empower every
        individual, unlocking human potential beyond barriers of class and circumstance. True progress is measured not
        by wealth, but by the dignity and freedom we extend to others. Let us envision a world where entrepreneurship
        drives social change, where every person becomes an architect of their own future, and where hope replaces
        despair."</p>
